# Troubleshooting GitHub Actions in Auto-GPT

## Introduction
This document is intended for contributors and maintainers of the Auto-GPT project. It provides guidance on troubleshooting common issues encountered with GitHub Actions, ensuring a smoother workflow and facilitating continuous integration and deployment processes.

## Common Errors and Their Potential Causes

### Failed Tests
- **Cause**: Differences in environment variables between local and CI environments.
- **Solution**: Ensure environment variables like `CI` and `GITHUB_ACTIONS` are correctly set to differentiate environments.

### Permission Issues
- **Cause**: Lack of necessary permissions for GitHub Actions to perform certain operations.
- **Solution**: Verify the GitHub token permissions in the workflow file `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

### Environment Variable Issues
- **Cause**: Missing or incorrect configuration of environment variables.
- **Solution**: Double-check the environment variables used in tests and deployment scripts.

## Steps to Diagnose Issues in GitHub Actions Runs

1. **Check GitHub Actions Logs**: Start by reviewing the error messages in the logs provided by GitHub Actions.
2. **Replicate CI Environment Locally**: Use Docker to replicate the CI environment on your local machine for further investigation.
3. **Use Conditional Test Skipping**: Utilize the `skip_in_ci` decorator in `autogpts/autogpt/tests/utils.py` to exclude tests not suitable for CI environments.

## How to Skip Tests or Modify Code Paths for CI Environments

- **Skipping Tests**: Apply the `@skip_in_ci` decorator to any test function you wish to exclude from CI environments.
- **Modifying Code Paths**: Check for the `CI` or `GITHUB_ACTIONS` environment variables to alter code execution paths when running in CI environments.
